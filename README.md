### Wireframe

The landing page design prominently features an input field for usernames, positioned centrally for immediate user attention. This serves as the core interactive element of the page. Flanking the username input, two buttons are thoughtfully situated. Beneath the input field, the "Play" button resides, beckoning users to explore the regulations guiding the experience. When interacted with, this button triggers the appearance of a modal overlay that succinctly presents the rules. Adjacent to the rules button, the "Rules" button awaits, poised to initiate the gameplay. However, its functionality is contingent upon the prior input of a valid username. This intentional design ensures a smooth flow: users first acquaint themselves with the rules before transitioning seamlessly to active participation through the play button, fostering an engaging and informed user experience, the background image will cover the whole page.

![Wireframe for landing page](assets/images/wireframe-land.png)

The quiz page design features a dynamic quiz box, structured to accommodate the user's engagement with a set of 10 questions. Each question is accompanied by four distinct answer choices, challenging the user's knowledge and decision-making. To infuse an element of urgency and excitement, a countdown timer prominently positioned near the quiz box ticks away 120 seconds, adding a time-sensitive dimension to the quiz-solving experience. Upon selecting an answer, users are transitioned to the next question. This design framework ensures that users navigate through the quiz efficiently, driven by both their knowledge and the race against time, ultimately culminating in an engaging quiz-taking encounter.

## Bugs

**Bug Description**

An issue arose when attempting to use username local storage on the home page, I added the below syntax to the script.js page and it was linked to my index.html file. When I entered a username, and hit the paly button my questions stored in my array would not load.

Commit message - try to fix bug error

![Username bug](assets/images/bug%20error.png)

![index html bug](assets/images/index-bug.png)

**Bug Resolution**

After extensive troubleshooting, utilizing insights and approaches detailed in the "Credits" section of this readme, I successfully resolved the bug. The issue, which resulted in the questions not loading correctly on the quiz page despite several attempts, required an innovative solution. By creating a separate file named Home.js and establishing a link between this file and the index.html, I was able to rectify the problem and ensure the questions loaded as expected. This solution not only eliminated the bug but also enhanced the overall performance of the quiz application. The experience underscores the value of collaboration and persistent problem-solving in software development.
